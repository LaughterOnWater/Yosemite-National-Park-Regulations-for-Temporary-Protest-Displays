# Yosemite-National-Park-Regulations-for-Temporary-Protest-Displays
The purpose of these regulations is to establish guidelines for temporary protest displays within Yosemite National Park, balancing the right to free speech with the preservation of the park's natural beauty and the safety of all visitors.

My only requirement for these is that if they end up getting used as a model, rough or otherwise by a park system, let me know and add that fact in the discussion area.
